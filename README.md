Project Name: All For One React Rebuild Pr -6
Description: Rebuilt my All for one website with React. 
Peer Review: Brock Spacek - Overall the functionality of the site was pretty spot on. I liked the drop down Navigation and the background video was pretty sick. There were a few responsive issues with styling. Also make sure that your input fields and instructions have the right ones. There was a couple times it was telling me to input a name for a question like on Magic8 or Enter only a number when anything was allowed. Just double check on those things and it should be pretty good
